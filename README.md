# GLEE_Simulations_Seismology
This repository contains simulations for the seismology payload of GLEE.

The simple simulation uses the inbuilt method model directly to get a quick understanding.
The simulation with boundary conditions is actually the final model required for answering the questions for feasibility. It implements rigorious boundary conditions,
